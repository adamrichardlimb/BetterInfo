# Adzy's Scoreboard

The TTT scoreboard holds a lot of useful data for playing the game. Sadly, in a game about watching your back, a big scoreboard that prevents you from seeing the game means no-one uses it to its full potential.

To fix this, I have made a better scoreboard. It sits on the right-hand side of the screen and tells you everything the basic scoreboard does.
